# Assignment #1
There are 2 files in this repo:
1.  python-intro.ipynp:  This is a simple python tutorial which will introduce you to some basic python concepts.   There are some simple exercises in this notebook.   
2.  assignment1.ipynb:  This is more complex assignment which will give you a bit more practice with python.

When you have completed this and made your changes to either of the above files, make sure you save the notebooks.   Saving can be done (at least) two ways:
* **MOST IMPORTANT** Dowloading to your local repo: click on File menu, then "Download .ipynb".  Then navigate to your local repo and save in the appropriate directory.   **You will still need to push to the remote github repo**, but this can be done later.
* To your google drive: Just click save.   You can find the notebook later by looking in your google drive: the file should be in a folder called "My Drive/Colab Notebooks".
